            Creating a Morph for a NPC in Dragon Age Origins
        </h1>
            When it comes to modding a game, it can seem quite daunting, even when looking to mod something small. For 
        Dragon Age: Origins, modding has been made easier by the release of the Dragon Age Toolset. Though with the
        loss of BioWare forums and with Dragon Age: Origins being 12 years old, finding instructions on how to use the 
        Dragon Age Toolset can be hard to find.</p>

            One of the easy ways to mod the game with the toolset is by creating a Morph. A Morph is more or less, the head 
        of a character, the model of their face. One of the easiest things to do with a morph, is create one for an NPC.
        The process only requires the Dragon Age Toolset, and can be completed in a matter of minutes.</p>

            These instructions will go through step by step how to create a morph and then replace a Non Player Character's default
        morph. </p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>This section will cover the creation of a Morph in the Dragon Age Toolset.</p>
          <p>The morph itself is the 3d model of the character's head. This model can be edited much like
            the way one can create a player character in the game itself, with customizing sliders and selections.
            However, nagivating the toolset and editing a morph in the toolset functions differently from the in-game 
            character creator.

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Opening New File</button>
              <div class="content">
                <p>When opening the program, first you need to create a new file. In the menu bar
                  under file > new, and select the <i>Morph</i> option in the dropdown menu.
                </p>

                  <div class="imgcaption">
                    <h4>Opening the File</h4>
                    In the Dragon Age Toolset, click on the <i>File</i> in the top left-hand corner, in the
                     dropdown menu, then hover over <i>New</i>. In the dropdown menu that appears, locate <i>Morph</i> which
                     is located roughly halfway down the list. Click <i>Morph</i>, this will create a new morph file.
                  </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>Nothing will appear at first, because in order to edit the morph, you need to select
                  the base morph. Dragon Age: Origins has seperate morphs for each race and gender. Humans,
                  for example, are split into the HM (Human Male) morph and the HF (Human Female) morph.
                </p>

                  <div class="imgcaption">
                    <h4>Selecting Base</h4>
                    The window will remain blank until you select an option in the <i>[Choose Base]</i> dropdown list.
                     This is located in the main toolbar under the <i>Help</i> menu.
                  </div>
                </div>
          
                <p>
                  In the dropdown box, you need to select the base for the character you are creating a morph for.
                  The first letter is the race (Human, Elf, Dwarf) and second letter is the gender (Male, Female).
                </p>

                  <div class="imgcaption">
                    <h4>Selecting Base Cont.</h4>
                    In the dropdown menu, the base models are listed. You need to select the appropriate base for the 
                    character you are creating a morph for. The models are: HM (Human Male), HF (Human Female), DM (Dwarf Male), 
                    DF (Dwarf Female), EM (Elf Male), EF (Elf Female), QM (Qunari Male), and KN (Human child).
                  </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>
                  For example, if you are creating a morph for Leliana, her morph needs to be HF.
                </p>

                <div class="imgcont">

                    <h4>Selecting Base Cont.</h4>
                    The morph needed for a character is simple to discern, as it is simply their race and gender. For the 
                    example, we will create a morph for Leliana. Leliana is a human female, so she needs the HF morph. Once 
                    a base is selected, the base will appear. Unlike the game, the toolset does not have preset faces aside 
                    from the base, so all morphs must be created from the appropriate base.

                <h3>Rotating Model</h3>
                <p>The model can be rotated by holding shift then holding right click with the mouse and dragging it.</p>
                <div class="imgcont">

                  <div class="imgcaption">
                    <h4>Rotating the Model</h4>
                    Instead of a button for rotation, rotating the model requires holding the SHIFT key while 
                    holding the <i>right click</i> button on the mouse and then moving the mouse. This rotates the model on the
                     horizontal axis (left and right).
                  </div>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Moving Camera</h3>
                <p>By holding CTRL and right clicking and dragging, you can rotate the camera on the positive vertical axis
                  (you can roate above the morph, but not below) and on the horizontal axis.
                </p>
                <div class="imgcont">
                  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OiKvI1y.png" style: width="80%">
                  <div class="imgcaption">
                    <h4>Rotating the Camera</h4>
                    The camera in the toolset can be rotated more than the model itself. By holding Control (CTRL) and holding 
                    the right mouse button while draggon the mouse, the camera can be rotated up and side to side. The camera cannot 
                    rotate under the model. At the default distance, when rotating up the camera clips (passes through) the model.
                  </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>By scrolling with the mouse wheel, you can move the camera in or out, you can also freely move the camera
                  by holding CTRL and dragging left click.
                </p>
                <div class="imgcont">

                  <div class="imgcaption">
                    <h4>Moving the Camera</h4>
                    To move the camera's position, you hold Control (CTRL) and hold <i>left click</i> while dragging the mouse. The 
                    Toolset's controls are sensitive, so small mouse movements corresponds to large camera movements.
                  </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>At any point, you can right click in the display and click the option zoom to object that appears. This will
                  return the camera to its default zoom, but will keep the angle the camera has.

                    <h4>Resetting the Camera</h4>
                    At any point, you can <i>left click</i> with the mouse on the display window. A small menu will pop up, and clicking 
                    the option <i>Zoom to Object</i> in the menu will effectively reset the camera's position. Any changes made to the 
                    camera's position or zoom will be undone and the camera will revert to its default placement. 
                  </div>

                <h3>View Settings</h3>
                
                <p>
                  Under the object inspector on the right hand side of the application, one of the tabs available is the
                  View Settings tab. Under this tab, positioning of the model and camera can be edited directly with numerical
                  values.
                </p>

                    <h4>Changing View Settings</h4>
                    Instead of using the mouse, the camera and model's position and rotation can be changed in the <i>View Settings</i> 
                    tab in the Object Inspector. The 13th tab in the object inspector has the numerical data for the camera and model position 
                    and rotation. These fields can be edited directly. This can be helpful especially for precise movements or angles you may
                     desire.

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Editing the Morph</button>
              
              <div class="content">
                <p>
                  This section will walk through the technical side of editing the morph, such as methods of editing and 
                  how unique aspects are edited. These are not instructions on the artistic aspect of creating a morph, as 
                  there is no one correct way to create a morph, only a correct way to use the tools. 
                </p>
                <h2>General Controls</h2> 
                <p>
                  To customize the morph, you simply edit the values shown in the Object Inspector window. Within the Object
                  Inspector there are 4 types of formats for customization options, these are file selection (kebab menu), 
                  value slider, mutually exclusive sliders, and multi option Sliders.
                </p>
                <h3>File Selection</h3>
                <div class ="subcontent">
                  <p>
                    File selection is used in fields that have one thing that needs to be selected, such as tint files
                    (the color of something, such as skin, hair, or makeup), textures, tattoos, beards, or hair. These may
                    appear alongside sliders.
                  </p>
                  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Selecting Files</button>
                  <div class="content">
                    <p>
                      In some fields, the value field shows a kebab button (a button with 3 dots, ...). Selecting that will
                      prompt a pop-up window in which a file must be chosen. All the files are from the game files, and the
                      correct directory is already open, all that is required is to select a file from the window.
                    </p>
                    <div class="imgcont">

                        <h4>Selecting a File</h4>
                        For some fields, there may be data or a blank area follwed by a <i>kebab</i> button, a button with 3 dots. 
                        For these fields, click the kebab button. This will bring up a window that allows the selection of a file 
                        for what is being customized. In this example, we are selecting the tint file (color) for the lip makeup. 
                      </div>
                    </div>

                <h3>Sliders</h3>
                <div class ="subcontent">
                  <p>
                    Sliders are the typical way to customize in game, something that carries over to the toolset.
                    Unlike the game, however, the sliders in the toolset are also commonly used for opacity (transparency).
                  </p>
                  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Using Sliders</button>
                  <div class="content">
                    <p>
                      For customization of things like the nose, eyes, mouth, etc. sliders are used identically to the game:
                      the slider corresponds to its titled value. For example, the slider for nose bridge width changes the width
                      of the morph's nose bridge width.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Sometimes, however, the toolset will pair both a file selection and a slider. In these cases,
                      the slider corresponds to the opacity or intensity of the file selected. For things like makeup, tattoos,
                      and eyebrows, the color or shape is selected, and the slider then allows to adjust the opacity of the color.
                    </p>

                      <div class="imgcaption">
                        <h4>Using a Slider</h4>
                        Similar to the character creation in game, sliders work by right clicking and dragging the pointer on 
                        the slider. The slider value can also be changed by clicking the slider field and scrolling with the mouse 
                        wheel. Some sliders for features allow for negative value, for the example though, the slider is for 
                        opacity so it cannot go below 0.
                      </div>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Mutually Exclusive Sliders</h3>
                    <div class ="subcontent">
                      <p>
                        Some sliders in the toolset present multiple possible sliders, but only one can be chosen.

                      <div class="content">
                        <p>
                          For some features, there are multiple sliders presented, such as for eye shape or for eyebrows.
                          Only one slider can be moved, by moving one slider to a value above the base value of 0, the other
                          sliders are greyed out and cannot be used. 
                        </p>

                            <h4>Using Mutally Exclusive Sliders</h4>
                            For some features, numerous sliders are presented but only one can be used. By changing the value of the slider, the other 
                            slider options become inaccesible. This can be undone by setting the slider to 0. 
                            In the example, the eyebrows sliders are mutually exclusive, The slider's value 
                            corresponds to the opacity of the slider's eyebrow. 
                          </div>
                        </div>

                          Notably, this is used for nose shapes. There are numerous preset nose shapes which can be used
                          with a slider, but all the sliders can be used at the same time. This allows for creating a nose shape
                          that is a mix of multiple shapes.

                            For a few sliders, numerous options are presented, but unlike the mutually exclusive sliders, 
                            all the sliders may be toggled and edited. In the example, we are using the slider for multiple 
                            nose shapes to create a nose shape that is a mix between the two preset shapes.

                          areas at any opacity.

                          the base game's "old" texture, and the skin texture slider changes the opacity of the colors from the "old"

                          the tattoo stores a unique tattoo in each color channel. In the example, you can see the 4 tattoos which

                    morph is listed as <i>Untitled.mrh</i>. This is the current name of the file, and the current file format.

                  An MRH File
                  is the <i>editable</i> file of a morph, not a file that the game can use. The file the game needs for a 
                  character's morph is a MOR file, which cannot be edited. While the MRH file is not needed after the morph is 
                  exported, it is <b>strongly recommeneded</b> that the MRH is saved, as without it, there is no way to edit 
                  the morph.

                  Before the morph can be exported, it must be saved. It does not matter where the file is saved, as the 
                  .mrh file is not one the game uses. As stated, though, it is strongly recommended to keep the file. The .mrh file 
                  can be named anything, it is recommended that you name it something descriptive, such as the name of the 
                  character you are creating a morph for.

                <p>
                  Once the .mrh file has been saved, the file can now be exported. To do this, you can either right click and choose
                  the <i>Post to Local</i> option that appears, or alternatively, Post to Local can be located under Tools > Export >
                   Post to Local.

                    whether the file exported sucessfully and where the file was exported to. The location of the exported file should 
                    be noted as the final steps involve locating the file in your file explorer. In the example, our morph was successfully 
                    exported to the ToolSetExport file in our Override folder.

                  as mentioned in the previous step. Regardless of your file's name, the exported MOR file will export with a prefix 
                  of the base model's abbrevation. For the example, the file was saved as Leliana.MRH but exported as HF_Leliana.MOR.

                bring up the character's information in the Object Inspector.

                  <h4>Finding the NPC</h4>
                  The creature list is organized by the game chapter for minor NPCs, but companions and major recurring characters 
                  are located under the <i>Global</i> folder. Once you locate the NPC you are planning to override, click on their name. 
                  In our example, Leliana is found under Global > Followers. 
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                In the Object Inspector, under the <i>Apperance</i> section, find the field for <i>Head Morph</i>>. For example,
                Leliana's Head Morph is hf_genfl_leliana.mor. This is what you need to rename your morph file.
              </p>

                  <h4>Finding the Morph Name</h4>
                  Once you click the NPC's name, the Object Inspector will populate with the information of that character's file. 
                  Among the information is a section called <i>Apperance</i>. It is under this section you can find the information of 
                  the NPC's head morph's name. For Leliana, her head morph is listed as hf_genfl_leliana.mor. 
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                Locate your exported .mor file and rename it the name listed (you can copy and paste it from the Toolset). 
              </p>
              <div class="imgcont">
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/W0oLriM.png" style: width="80%">

                  <h4>Rename your Morph</h4>
                  Your morph file must have the name that is listed as the NPC's head morph. Copy the name of the morph, then return 
                  to your file explorer and locate your file. Right click the file, click rename, and paste the name from the Toolset. 
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                Now that the morph is in the correct format and has the correct name, now it can be used to override the default
                 morph.
              </p>
            </div>
          <button type="button" class="collapsible">Placing the File in Override</button>
            <div class="content">
              <p>In your Documents Folder, click on BioWare > Dragon Age > Modules > Single Player > Overrride, and place
                the correctly named morph from the previous step. This will override the default morph.
              </p>

                  <h4>Placing the File</h4>
                  Cut or copy the file you just renamed. Then, in your documents folder, click on Bioware > Dragon Age > Modules > 
                  Singe Player > Override. In this folder, paste the morph. In our example, we cut the file from its original place and 
                  placed in in this directory.
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                You can now play the game as usual and your new morph will be in it! 
              </p>

                  <h4>Launch the Game</h4>
                  The game can now be launched from Steam or Origin. If you have a save with your player near the NPC you edited,
                  open that save and you can quickly check how the morph looks in game. If you desire to change it you can then return 
                  to the editing and export process. In our example, we opened a save with the Player Character at the party camp and initiated dialogue 
                  with Leliana, where you can see she has the new morph. 
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                If you desire to change the morph after its in game, simply export a new morph, and follow the same renaming steps,
                 and place it in the folder mentioned above.
